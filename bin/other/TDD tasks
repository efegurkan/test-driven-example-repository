Basic tasks for TDD - from TDD by Example by Kent Beck

1. Red - Write a little test that doesn't work, and doesn't even compile at first time.
2. Green - make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process
3. Refactor - eliminate all the duplication created in just getting the test to work
